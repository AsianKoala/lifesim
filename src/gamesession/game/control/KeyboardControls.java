        " taken as 1 input, previous inputs are NOT saved; only the current input(1) input is read. Because of this, when you hold down a key, and then press another key, the 2nd key will be " +
        " read, but because the 1st key is no longer the one who was pressed down. To solve this normal keyboards have this thing called rollover, but we have to program " +
        " it in since KeyAdapter sucks that way. So we just assign values to booleans and have a logic method that sorts out movementX and movementY. Kinda dumb but whatever lol." +
